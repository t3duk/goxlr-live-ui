In the world of radio, presenters have lights to tell them when their microphone is live. This is quite hard to replicate in a home studio, therefore, with a GoXLR and this software you can have a virtual mic light!

## Features

- Reacts to the microphone mute button on the GoXLR
- Small and quick
- No unnecessary features

## Limitations

- Currently, only works with one GoXLR. If your setup has two, the program will use the GoXLR which was first on the API.
- Only reacts to fader A mute button, yet to be customizable.
- Only available on windows, unless some genius makes it compatible/makes binaries for other OSs. (dw im a mac fanboy too)
